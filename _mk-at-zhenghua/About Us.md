# About Us

We offer 4-hour K1 and K2 programmes for children. You can choose from the following options:

*   Morning session (8am to 12pm)
*   Afternoon session (1pm to 5pm)

  

**Kindergarten Care**

We also offer Kindergarten Care (KCare), a full-day service. If you register, your child will be in KCare before and after your selected MK session, providing the convenience of a full-day service.

Our Vision, Mission & Beliefs
-----------------------------

Our vision is to provide a strong start for every child. We seek to do so through providing quality pre-school education that is affordable to Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents aged 5 and 6.

  

We believe that children are curious, active and competent learners. They are keen to make sense of the world around them and they learn best through active learning.

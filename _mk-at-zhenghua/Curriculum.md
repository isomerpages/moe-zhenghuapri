# Curriculum

Our curriculum is designed by pre-school specialists to nurture children holistically to be confident, possess strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy. We offer the three Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) – Chinese, Malay and Tamil – to encourage bilingualism in the early years and help lay a strong foundation for language learning in the later years.

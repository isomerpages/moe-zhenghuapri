# Values-in-Action

VIA aims to nurture our students to become socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the **learning and application of values, knowledge and skills**. As part of VIA, students **reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully**.

  

Culture of **C.A.R.E**

  

VIA at Zhenghua reinforces the culture of **C.A.R.E** as exemplified by our students who are:

*   cognizant of the current issues that are happening around them or in the community
*   appreciative of what they have, and the people around them
*   reflective and engage in critical thinking as they strive to solve problems
*   empathetic and understand the feelings and perspectives of other people

Pedagogical Approach: **3A** through **L.A.R**

**A**ction, **A**wareness, **A**dvocate through **L**earn, **A**pply, **R**eflect

VIA programmes provide opportunities for students to:

*   to take an **A**ction to improve a situation that they care about or to show gratitude to others who have contributed actively to the community
*   to promote **A**wareness about an issue of concern in the community
*   to become **A**dvocates to inspire and influence others to make a difference in something that they care about

Students explicitly **learn** core values through CCE lessons, assembly and pre-assembly talks, Love Talk by students, Values-Based and Contemporary Issues sharing by School Leaders and Key Personnel.

  

Students gets the opportunity to **apply** their learning and engage in VIA activities that positively impact their peers, family, and the community.

  

**Reflective** practice in VIA inspires students to become empathetic problem solvers as well as instils a sense of gratitude in them.

## Student-Centric & Student Agency

Students are given opportunities to share their opinions on how they can show values in action during face-to-face class discussion and through CCE Inquiry activities posted on SLS.

Through these opportunities, students are inspired to lead VIA projects in school.

# Values-in-Action

VIA aims to nurture our students to become socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the **learning and application of values, knowledge and skills**. As part of VIA, students **reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully**.

  

Culture of **C.A.R.E**

  

VIA at Zhenghua reinforces the culture of **C.A.R.E** as exemplified by our students who are:

*   cognizant of the current issues that are happening around them or in the community
*   appreciative of what they have, and the people around them
*   reflective and engage in critical thinking as they strive to solve problems
*   empathetic and understand the feelings and perspectives of other people

Pedagogical Approach: **3A** through **L.A.R**

**A**ction, **A**wareness, **A**dvocate through **L**earn, **A**pply, **R**eflect

*   to promote **A**wareness about an issue of concern in the community
*   to become **A**dvocates to inspire and influence others to make a difference in something that they care about

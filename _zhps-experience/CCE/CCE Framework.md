# CCE Framework

![](/images/ZHPS%20Experience/CCE%20Framework.jpg)

In ZHPS, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) aims to develop our students to become leaders of character and active citizens who contribute positively.

  

As leaders of character, students are expected to:

*   lead by example – being a good role model and earning the trust and respect of others
*   serve with humility and care – taking good care of others and putting others before self
*   take initiative to make a difference – going the extra mile and creating positive changes
*   influence others to do what is right – promoting positive thoughts, attitude and behaviour


To lead themselves and others effectively, they should possess social-emotional competencies, namely self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management and responsible decision making. They are anchored in values and consistently live out the school values (RI2C2E):

<u>CCE (FTGP)</u>

Explicit teaching of values happens during CCE (Form Teacher Guidance Period) lessons. These lessons also provide the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with their students through discussions and effective classroom strategies to help bring meaning to core values and key social-emotional competencies to better navigate the real world.

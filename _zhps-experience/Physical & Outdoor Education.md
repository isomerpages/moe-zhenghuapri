## Physical development through the PE curriculum

The school physical education programme aims to provide a range of movement experiences to strengthen the students’ body, mind and soul. It also aims to help to develop a foundation and interest for an active lifestyle. The lower primary level curriculum focuses on the teaching and mastery of fundamental motor skills and concepts. The school believes the complete spectrum of fundamental motor skills and concepts are important building blocks for the learning of specialised skills across a variety of physical activities. The upper primary levels focus on further refinement of basic movement patterns and the development of the combined skills to help them move with increasing complexity, variety, and versatility to take on more challenging movement activities and tasks.

  

The motor skills and movement concepts framework identifies the three different fundamental motor skills and the four broad aspects of movement concepts. The school designs the PE curriculum based on this framework to promote students’ competence in motor skills. More importantly, we combine the skills, movement concepts and principles to enhance understanding, mastery and application of movement skills.

## Character development through the PE curriculum

The PE curriculum framework comes in the shape of a sail boat as we believe the development of our students through the PE curriculum is more of a journey rather than the destination. It is through the process of learning that the pupils’ body, mind and soul are strengthened. The shape of a sail boat also depicts the need to adapt to the winds of change ever so prevalent in the 21st century landscape and to acquire the emerging 21st century competencies. However, as the pupils embark on the journey towards mastery of change and steer through the seas of change, they must be guided and grounded with strong core values. The PE curriculum aims to provide an authentic setting for the pupils to learn and practice values and ideals, develop appropriate social interaction skills, and express as well as control emotions that support the development of character.

  

The table below shows how the various socio emotional and Emerging 21st competencies predominantly serves as prerequisites as well as outcomes of the PE goals, and what desired outcomes to be derived from the goals.

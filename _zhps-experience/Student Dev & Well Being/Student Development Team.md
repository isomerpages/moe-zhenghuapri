# Student Development Team

At Zhenghua Primary School, the Student Development Team (SDT) oversees the holistic development of our students. The SDT looks into the student well-being and takes care of students’ socio-emotional needs. The SDT aims to enhance the quality of our students’ school experiences, bearing in mind that the time spent with peers and guidance of teachers is what made school enjoyable for our students.

# Counselling Programme

## Counselling at Zhenghua Primary School  (HeartSpace@ ZHPS)

The counselling team is made up of counsellors and our Student Welfare Officer where we work in providing a safe environment for students to share their challenges and work through their social, emotional, behaviourial and mental health issues with us.

  

A School Counsellor supports students by helping them learn and use strategies to manage and cope with their emotions or situation and enables them to make choices for positive change and development.

  

Counseling services are the heartbeat of ZhengHua Primary School . Counselors take a proactive, child-centered, and developmental approach in working with students, parents, and teachers. ZHPS counselors teach character education lessons, provide individual and help refer out for family counseling, facilitate small group workshops for students, have parent coffee sessions, do transitional programs, and coordinate student services in the school.

## How can School Counselling help?

The counselling team helps to build Self Awareness, Social Awareness, Relationship Skills, Self Management and Responsible Decision Making


School counselling sessions can:

*   Provide someone who will listen to your concerns with care, respect and confidentiality as when you need someone to talk to or to listen to you.
*   Give students opportunities to explore your feelings and thoughts, examine options, weigh alternatives and gain new perspectives of yourself, the situation and your environment for the situation you are facing.
*   Help students work on their self-acceptance, self-worth and confidence.
*   Help students manage the challenges they face more effectively by enabling them to make choices for themselves

## The Role of the Student Welfare Officer

Student Welfare Support refers to the work with students with attendance issues. These students may not attend school regularly due to their family or home situations, lack of motivation for learning or poor peer influence.


A Student Welfare Officer assesses the needs of students with poor school attendance and works with community partners, parents and teachers to address their needs and help them return to school.

**Referral to specialists or community agencies**

Students who require more intensive intervention will be referred to our Lead School Counsellors, Lead Student Welfare Officers or mental health professionals from our school network. These would include FSCs, MSF, REACH, NAMS, TOUCH.

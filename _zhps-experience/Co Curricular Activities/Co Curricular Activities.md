# Co-Curricular Activities

CCAs programmes develop&nbsp;**Character**, foster&nbsp;**Camaraderie**&nbsp;&amp; imbue in students positive&nbsp;**Attitude**.<br>
CCA strives to support the holistic development of a student, guided by the vision that every student is physically and culturally vibrant at the end of his 6 years in Zhenghua. <br>
In Zhenghua, our primary aim is to seek and provide opportunities for all students via CCA program to help develop them holistically, in and out of the classroom, and ample opportunities to specialize and develop a student’s passion &amp; nurture his talent to the fullest.<br>
We achieve this through our&nbsp;**3E**&nbsp;(Exposure, Enrichment and Excellence) approaches:

|  |  |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **Exposure:**   | To provide students with a variety of platforms for exposure to the different learning experiences to realise their potential through CCA. This experience includes experiences for all, and experiences for your core team. |
| **Enrichment:** | Skillset gained through active participation in CCA thus ensuring growth in their skills and knowledge. |
| **Excellence:** | Exposure to various platforms that would offer opportunities to enhance and further hone students’ skills. This may come in the form of competitions, performances, exhibitions at various levels (inter-school, national or international). Platform which allows students to perform the best that they can be, it is about their personal excellence. |

We provide students with broad experience through variety of CCAs comprising of the 4 domains:

a\.  The Performing Arts - instill in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society.   
b\.  Sports - aim to develop robustness, fair play, and team spirits in students.   
c\.  Uniformed Group - aim to make good citizens of students by inculcating discipline and a spirit of service to others.   
d\.  Clubs - strive to achieve oratorical and communication skills, which fosters leadership, self-motivation, and personal growth. <br>

After going through the programme, each student will:

√&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Develop&nbsp;**strength of Character**,&nbsp;**foster Camaraderie**&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;**inculcate good Attitude**;  
√&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have the opportunity to be immersed into a vibrant Arts Culture &amp; be developed physically, where he can be gracious yet rugged;

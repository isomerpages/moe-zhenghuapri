# PAL

PAL stands for Programme for Active Learning. It is an MOE initiative to address the greater emphasis on non-academic programmes for P1 and P2 students.

The objectives of PAL are to provide students with broad exposure and experiences through fun & varied activities and to provide varied avenues to develop social emotional competencies. It is also to facilitate holistic development of students in the five domains, that is, moral, cognitive, physical, social and aesthetics.

PAL complements Art, Music and PE, and it provides the platform for students to extend, reinforce and apply their learning

#### Goals of Science Education
--------------------------

*   Enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they are able to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives; and

*   Provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

#### Vision of Science Education
---------------------------

*   Inspired by Science. Students enjoy learning Science, and are fascinated by how everyday phenomena have scientific connections and how Science helps solve many of our global challenges. They regard Science as relevant and meaningful, and appreciate how Science and Technology have transformed the world and improved our lives.

*   Inquire like Scientists. Students have strong fundamentals in Science, and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry. They are able to engage confidently in the Practices of Science, grounded in the knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the environment.

*   Innovate using Science. Students apply Science to generate creative solutions to solve real-world problems, ranging from those affecting everyday lives to complex problems affecting humanity.

#### Inquiry Based Learning
----------------------

Science in Zhenghua Primary is taught using the Inquiry approach.

  

In inquiry-based learning, teachers engage the students through a problem, question or narrative.  
Students are then involved in hands-on activities to make observations and collect evidence to support their claims.


Teachers are facilitators who help pupils make connections and build their understanding of scientific concepts.

#### P5 STEM Programme
----------------
The STEAM (**S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering, **A**rt, **M**athematics) programme provides our students with an opportunity to connect ideas from different academic disciplines. They actively use their imagination and creativity, to apply their understanding of electrical principles. The student design an Triorama in their art lesson which connects ideas from Mathematics and Art. The students used the Microbits to code instructions for the device for an energy-saving light circuit for their artwork.

#### P3 Self Directed Learning (SDL) Day for Science

The annual P3 SDL day provides our students with a platform to apply science in a story-based setting. The students were tasked to use recyclable materials to design an amphibious vehicle that can carry set of weights over a distance. We celebrated the students efforts with a level gathering to showcase the best performing vehicles.

#### Learning Journeys to Science Centre Singapore for P4 and P6 students

Learning journeys provides learning experiences that expands our studentsâ€™ appreciation of science. Out-of-classroom learning experiences exposes our students to appreciate the creativity of using scientific principles in different ways. These hands-on explorations encourage our students to identify connections between the classroom and the world around them.

#### Collaboration with the Singapore Heart Foundation for P5 students

Our P5 students collaborated with educators from the Singapore Heart Foundation to learn more about heart health. They participated in activities that allows them to explore the functions of the blood pressure monitor. They left the session with ideas to live a healthier lifestyle.

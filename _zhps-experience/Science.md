Inquiry Based Learning
----------------------

Science in Zhenghua Primary is taught using the Inquiry approach.

  

In inquiry-based learning, teachers engage the students through a problem, question or narrative.  
Students are then involved in hands-on activities to make observations and collect evidence to support their claims.


Teachers are facilitators who help pupils make connections and build their understanding of scientific concepts.

# Applied Learning Programme

## About ZHPS Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

The ALP at Zhenghua Primary brings to the fore, the core issue of sustainable living. We aim to develop “Advocates and Innovators for Sustainable Living” through our school’s ALP. It involves students in interdisciplinary inquiry-based learning, design thinking and value creation to address authentic problems related to sustainable living in collaboration with community partners.

It is Interdisciplinary in nature and focuses on getting students to apply their learning across subjects. The use of real-world scenarios and problems encourages them to transfer knowledge and skills acquired.

Students

*   investigate the issues and work together to build their collective understanding of the issues

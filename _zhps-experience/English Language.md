**Authentic Learning Experiences**  

<u>A Butterfly is Born</u>

Students will be captivated as they learn about metamorphosis and watch their caterpillars grow beautiful wings. Growing butterflies is definitely a fun way to teach our students writing.

 <u>A Meal with My Family</u>

Students share how they have bonded with their family members over a meal. Students are encouraged to take ownership over their own learning, provide constructive feedback to their peers, and showcase their creativity in creating artefacts for their Show and Tell.

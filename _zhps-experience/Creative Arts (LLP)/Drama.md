# Drama

In Zhenghua Primary School, **Drama in Education** uses drama as a teaching tool to engage students in **fictional contexts**, which allows them to discover and make sense of being in the world.

As a strategy or a pedagogical tool, drama is a **creative process** for learning. It is conducted in the classroom during curriculum time. It is one of the key features in our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and in subjects such as English Language, Mother Tongue and Social Studies.

  

Drama encourages students to take on fictional characters and explore feelings, thoughts and emotions within those fictional settings. Students present their **creativity and thinking** through in-class presentations or performances.

While engaging students through dramatic play, learning of the curriculum becomes enhanced through the exploration and discovery of ideas and concepts during the process.

During the drama lessons, students are involved in the processes of **_Making_**, **_Performing_** and **_Responding_**.

Dramatic activities centre on the **conventions of drama** such as role-playing and improvisation. Other conventions used regularly as a way of working in the drama include hot seating, freeze frame and teacher-in-role.

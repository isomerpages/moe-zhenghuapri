# Dance

The Dance Arts Education (DArE) @ Zhenghua Primary School is a customised programme, where students are given exposure to dance education during formal curriculum. It is specially conceptualized and designed to develop students into ‘culturally vibrant’ citizens.

  

DArE has a strong National Education element, where students are exposed to dances of the three main ethnic groups in Singapore and other international dances. Such exposure encourages students to develop an awareness and appreciation of different cultures as well as to embrace diversity.

Students are taught fundamentals of dance movements and the ways to create movements in accordance with music. They are also required to choreograph their dance routines.

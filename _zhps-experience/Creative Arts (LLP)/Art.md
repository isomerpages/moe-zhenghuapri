# Art
The Art department adopts the following big ideas that are presented in the syllabus framework. They are:

\-    Art helps us to see in new ways.  
\-    Art tells stories about our world.  
\-    Art influences how we live.

These big ideas guide the design of the curriculum in our school. A spiral curriculum is designed based on the 32 artworks and learning domains of _Seeing_, _Expressing_ and _Appreciating Arts_ as prescribed by the Arts Educational Branch.

The learning content is enhanced through customising its curriculum to include Inquiry-Based Learning, Choice-Based Art Classrooms, Interdisciplinary Museum Based Learning and Cultural Art Studies across the different levels. Our school also adopts the Artful Thinking Routines for art discussions.

Meanwhile, Art enrichment programmes support the curriculum in enhancing and engaging students with a keen interest in the subject.

# Art
The Art department adopts the following big ideas that are presented in the syllabus framework. They are:

\-    Art helps us to see in new ways.  
\-    Art tells stories about our world.  
\-    Art influences how we live.

These big ideas guide the design of the curriculum in our school. A spiral curriculum is designed based on the 32 artworks and learning domains of _Seeing_, _Expressing_ and _Appreciating Arts_ as prescribed by the Arts Educational Branch.

The learning content is enhanced through customising its curriculum to include Inquiry-Based Learning, Choice-Based Art Classrooms, Interdisciplinary Museum Based Learning and Cultural Art Studies across the different levels. Our school also adopts the Artful Thinking Routines for art discussions.

Meanwhile, Art enrichment programmes support the curriculum in enhancing and engaging students with a keen interest in the subject.

## Learning Through Art - Collaboration with Departments and Organisations


In promoting Art appreciation further, art is integrated in other subjects to support students’ learning and understanding of concepts and ideas. The department thus, actively collaborates with various departments in school and external organisations to engage students and promote learning.

**(b) Primary 4 Interdisciplinary Museum Based Learning (IMBL)**

The Primary 4 Interdisciplinary Museum Based Learning is a collaborative programme between National Gallery Singapore (NGS) and our school. Through this programme, artworks found in NGS are introduced to our students. The valuable resources are also used to create meaningful connections between art and different curriculum studies.

For example, students are engaged in discussions of artworks to discover the connections across subjects such as English Language, Social Studies, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and the Malay Language.

The Art Gallery is the pride and joy of the school. Completed in 2021, the gallery is a space to showcase the artworks of our students.

  

A set of gallery lessons are also customised for our students. They learn basic gallery etiquette and will be engaged in exciting lessons using the artworks in the gallery. A part of the gallery will also be opened to the students to learn how to curate artworks.

## Art – The Co-Curriculum

The Young Budding Artists is an art enrichment programme specially crafted for our selected Primary 2 students. These students will engage in hands-on, skill-based activities that will enhance and develop their artistic flair beyond the general art programme.

Our young budding artists will get to enjoy a wide spectrum of creative processes. In the pursue of their artistic journey, they will learn about renowned master artists and their art movement. Whereafter, they get to explore the elements of various art materials as they create their meaningful artistic experience.

  

Students who go through the programme are then identified and encouraged to pursue their interest and hone their art skills further in Talent Art Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) at Primary 3.

## Talent Art Programme

Budding artists are channelled to the Talent Art Programme (TArP) which maximises students’ talents in their art. Our young artists’ talents are further developed and nurtured. They are provided with opportunities to develop their visual literacy and critical thinking skills. Students get to inquire and discover various ways to interpret the various art concepts through deep discussion and meaningful art processes, and learn to make choices and solve problems when working on their artwork.


Our programme has always capitalised on different platforms available to give avenues for our students to present and grow in confidence, a desire of us to equip students with 21st Century Competencies. Our students get to participate in the various exciting platforms to showcase their artistic talent. They have always been involved in partnership projects with Bukit Panjang Community Club in their PAssionArts programmes. A collaboration with NGS also allowed our students to broaden their insights in the area of art genre and mediums.

  

Students are active participants in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition and they have presented in Art Outreach, another SYF fringe activity, to showcase their love for art to the general public.

## Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition


The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) is organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to showcase the talents of the students’ work yearly. As part of providing experience for exposure at national events, our students participate in the SYF.

  

Our Young Budding Artists (Primary 2) and Talent Art students (Primary 3 to Primary 6) are given the opportunity to showcase their artwork at the recent Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition 2021.

Below are the students’ achievements at the SYF 2021 Art Exhibition:

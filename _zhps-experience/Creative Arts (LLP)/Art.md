# Art
The Art department adopts the following big ideas that are presented in the syllabus framework. They are:

\-    Art helps us to see in new ways.  
\-    Art tells stories about our world.  
\-    Art influences how we live.

These big ideas guide the design of the curriculum in our school. A spiral curriculum is designed based on the 32 artworks and learning domains of _Seeing_, _Expressing_ and _Appreciating Arts_ as prescribed by the Arts Educational Branch.

The learning content is enhanced through customising its curriculum to include Inquiry-Based Learning, Choice-Based Art Classrooms, Interdisciplinary Museum Based Learning and Cultural Art Studies across the different levels. Our school also adopts the Artful Thinking Routines for art discussions.

Meanwhile, Art enrichment programmes support the curriculum in enhancing and engaging students with a keen interest in the subject.

## Learning Through Art - Collaboration with Departments and Organisations


In promoting Art appreciation further, art is integrated in other subjects to support students’ learning and understanding of concepts and ideas. The department thus, actively collaborates with various departments in school and external organisations to engage students and promote learning.

**(b) Primary 4 Interdisciplinary Museum Based Learning (IMBL)**

The Primary 4 Interdisciplinary Museum Based Learning is a collaborative programme between National Gallery Singapore (NGS) and our school. Through this programme, artworks found in NGS are introduced to our students. The valuable resources are also used to create meaningful connections between art and different curriculum studies.

For example, students are engaged in discussions of artworks to discover the connections across subjects such as English Language, Social Studies, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and the Malay Language.

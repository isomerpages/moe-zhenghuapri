\* Students revisit the study of musical instruments previously learnt in preparation for Ensemble in Semester 2.

\*\* Piloted in 2022 for a class in Primary 5’s English Language and a class in Primary 6 for Social Studies.

  

The infusion of the arts in the various disciplines also enable students to learn through the arts, appreciate different art forms and cultures, and develop creative and critical thinking. Students’ personal voice is also developed as they are given opportunities to express themselves through the arts. The school provides platforms for students to serve the community through arts performances and arts outreach programmes.

  

**Creative Arts@Zhenghua** is aligned to one of the school’s Strategic Thrusts – ‘Every Student a Confident, Creative and Expressive Learner’.

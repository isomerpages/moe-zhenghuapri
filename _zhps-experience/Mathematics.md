# Mathematics

Vision
------

Every student a thinker and a resilient problem solver.

*   To develop our students to be STAR problem solvers, the department has adopted the 4-step Poyla Problem Solving strategies in the teaching of Mathematics in Zhenghua Primary School.

|:-:|:-----------:|
| **S** | Study to understand the question<br>(Underline important information) |
| **T** | Think of a plan<br>(Choose a suitable strategy)                       |
| **A** | Act on the plan <br>(Write equations and show working)                |
| **R** | Review: Check your answer                    |

Mission
-------

*   To build a strong Mathematical foundation in students.
    
*    To foster joy in the learning of Mathematics.
    
*    To engage students through various learning of Mathematics.
    
*    To engage students through various learning experiences.
    
*    To develop reasoning and communication skills in students.
    
*   To give students opportunities to appreciate and apply Mathematics in real life context.
    

Department's Focus
------------------

*   We believe that every child wants to and can learn. The Math Department aims to enable our students to: 
    
    *   acquire Mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use
        
    *   develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application, and   metacognitive skills
        
    *   build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics.
        
    

Key Approaches
--------------

1\. **Using Concrete to Pictorial to Abstract (C-P-A) Approach**

To enhance conceptual understanding, our teachers make use of CPA (Concrete to Pictorial to Abstract) Approach in the teaching of Mathematics in the classroom. Students have the opportunities to make use manipulatives such as base-ten blocks, number discs and fraction bars to better understand the Mathematical concepts and this makes learning more fun at the same time.   

2\. **Enhancing Learning Experiences**

To ignite the joy of learning in Mathematics, students are provided with different opportunities to apply concepts and skills learnt in real-life context. 


3\. **Making Thinking Visible through Mathematical Reasoning and Communication**



To develop a thinker and a resilient problem solver, our students are encouraged to communicate their reasoning and connections through various Mathematical tasks and activities such as performance tasks. Students are given opportunities to discuss and express their thoughts and ideas in both verbal and written forms (Mathematical Journal Writing). As a result, our students will be able to develop the capacities to think critically, creatively as well as confidently. 

Mathematics Department Programmes
---------------------------------

**P3 Math Shopping Day – Self-Directed Learning**

P3 Shopping allows students to see the connection between the mathematics they complete in the classroom and the world outside the classroom. Students engage in decision-making, exercise adaptability, and communicate their ideas during the shopping experience. The concept of money is also further consolidated and enhanced as students make purchases within a given budget for their group party which they have planned the day before.  

  

**<u>P</u>lay <u>A</u>nd <u>L</u>earn </u>M</u>ath (PALM) @ the Classroom - P1 to P6**

To inculcate the love for the subject, the Mathematics Department organises PALM @ the Classroom for our students. The programme aims to:

*   provide more opportunities for students to be more engaged during Math lessons.
    

*   inject fun into lessons, besides having hands-on activities.
    
*   guide children to make meaning out of what they learn through purposeful play.
    
*   help students manage their ‘real-world’ problems, (for example, taking turns).

### Vision

Every staff and student are competent in the use of ICT to carry out self-directed and collaborative learning in a safe and responsible manner.  

### Mission


Enhance the ICT environment that supports and guides all staff and students to be engaged in teaching and learning.  

### ICT Department Programmes

A comprehensive ICT Baseline Skills programme has been implemented to equip students with essential digital competencies. This initiative encompasses fundamental login procedures and navigation of the Student Learning Space (SLS) interface, as well as familiarisation with the Zoom platform, enabling students to participate independently in Home-Based Learning (HBL) sessions.
As students’ progress, they develop touch typing proficiency and are introduced to basic video editing techniques. These skills are designed to prepare our learners for the increasingly technology-driven society that they will encounter, positioning them well to adapt to and thrive in future academic and professional environments.<br>
Furthermore, coding has been incorporated into our STEM curriculum. This aspect of the programme emphasises practical application, demonstrating real-world relevance while maintaining an engaging and enjoyable learning experience. By mastering these digital tools, our students will be well-prepared to apply their skills in various contexts as they navigate our technology-driven society in the near future.<br>

During our students’ schooling years with us, we will complement our ICT lessons with the National Literacy Programme which covers digital literacy, digital competencies and the technological skills. This is to ensure that students are well-equipped with the digital competencies to thrive in an increasingly technology-saturated future.

#### Digital literacy
Digital literacy is defined as a set of knowledge, skills and dispositions that would help our learners to be confident, critical and responsible users of digital technologies.
MOE’s National Digital Literacy Programme was launched in March 2020 for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning. Under the programme, students will acquire digital skills across four components in the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework.

#### Digital competencies
Under the EdTech Masterplan 2030, the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework is further unpacked into 9 digital competencies to support deepening of digital literacy in schools.

#### 9 Digital Competencies covers:

**1.Digital Safety &amp; Security**<br>
Understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in the online space.<br>
**2.Digital Responsibility**<br>
When navigating the online space, demonstrate respect for oneself and others, and practise safe, responsible and ethical use.<br>
**3.Digital Knowledge Currency**<br>
Keep oneself up-to-date with technological developments and the use of digital resources as part of learning for life.<br>
**4.Computational Thinking**<br>
Employ computational thinking together with technological tools to solve problems e.g. when developing and testing solutions.<br>
**5.Digital Information Management**<br>
Employ effective strategies to locate information and resources, and exercise discernment by evaluating the accuracy, credibility, and relevance of information. Distil and synthesise essential content from the often large amount of information available online.<br>
**6.Digital Communication, Collaboration &amp; Participation**<br>
Leverage digital platforms and tools to communicate ideas, connect with others and contribute constructively to a common goal.<br>
**7.Data Competencies**<br>
Read, understand, interpret, manipulate, analyse and present data in meaningful ways.<br>
**8.Device &amp; Software Operations**<br>
Understand how devices and software work in order to use them effectively and productively.
**9.Coding &amp; Programming**<br>
Utilise a variety of digital methods such as block-based programming, text-based programming, prompt engineering to create digital artefacts or to develop, test and debug solutions.<br>

#### Technological skills
Technological skills refer to the ability to understand and use specific technologies to solve problems and achieve practical goals.

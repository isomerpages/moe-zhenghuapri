# Brownies

Our motto “Lend a Hand” guides us through our sessions. In Brownies, we focus on developing our girls to be independent and caring individuals who contribute to society. Every week, Brownies learn new skills and are challenged to try new activities. There are many opportunities given for Brownies to lead and hone their leadership skills.<br>

Brownies engage in many group activities where they learn about teamwork and exercise the value of collaboration. Our Brownies also collaborate with other Brownie units for joint learning adventures like West Division Days and West Division Learning Days. Through these activities, Brownies have fun while learning to care for others and forge lasting friendships.<br>

Additionally, our Brownies work on attaining proficiency and interest badges which helps them develop new skills. Character development is infused into weekly sessions where Brownies learn about the importance of working harmoniously in groups. All these activities help develop the girls to become a confident and caring individual.

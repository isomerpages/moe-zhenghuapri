# Floorball

In the Floorball CCA, all the members have the following vision, mission, and philosophy.

  

The school core values are incorporated during our weekly CCA sessions.

  

Floorball is a fast-paced game that not only requires good teamwork and stamina but also quick and flexible thinking in order to strategies effective gameplay. We begin the training with warm-up exercises followed by drills such as passing, shooting and goal scoring. These trainings not only build up our fitness and skills, but also train us in our perseverance and determination, reminding us of the importance of never giving up.

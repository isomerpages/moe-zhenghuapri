# Basketball

Our motto is “Practise with purpose, play with passion”. Basketball CCA provides the platform for students to hone basic basketball skills as well as tactical knowledge in attacking and defending. Our weekly CCA training begins with warm-up exercises led by a student followed by drills such as dribbling, passing and shooting. Besides developing their basketball skills, students also learn the importance of good sportsmanship and the values of collaboration, respect and resilience through game play and the CCE in CCA sessions conducted by our teachers.

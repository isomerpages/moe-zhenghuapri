# Core Beliefs

1.  We love, value and accept our students for who they are.
2.  We believe that every child is special and talented in his/her own way. Through what we do, we seek to bring out the best in each of our students.
3.  We believe that, with effective effort, our students can improve themselves and are capable of achieving their personal best.

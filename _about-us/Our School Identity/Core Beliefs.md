# Core Beliefs

1\.  We love, value and accept our students for who they are.<br>
2\.  We believe that every child is special and talented in his/her own way. Through what we do, we seek to bring out the best in each of our students.<br>
3\.  We believe that, with effective effort, our students can improve themselves and are capable of achieving their personal best.

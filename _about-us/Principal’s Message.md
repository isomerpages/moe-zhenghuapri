Zhenghua Primary School is a school with a rich story – one shaped by dedicated educators and staff,
supportive stakeholders and students who strive to be “the best that they (we) can be” (our school
motto). It is with great honour and a deep sense of purpose that I join this school community as
principal.<br><br>
From my earliest interactions with the school staff and students, I have been inspired by the energy,
care and collaboration that define our school. This is a place where joy of learning is valued,
relationships matter and every child is encouraged to grow and develop.<br><br>
Our school is guided by a clear mission: to nurture the whole child in a caring, innovative, collaborative
and vibrant learning environment. A vibrant learning environment is one where curiosity is sparked,
ideas are explored and student voice is nurtured. A meaningful example of student voice in action was
when a student took the initiative to write a thoughtful proposal to the principal last year, after rallying
his classmates behind his idea to improve the school experience for him and his classmates. After
discussion with the teachers, the idea was implemented, demonstrating that student perspectives are
valued and that they can play an active role in shaping school life.<br><br>
As we look ahead, we will continue to strengthen teaching and learning through innovation,
collaboration and reflective practice. We will work together to make our classrooms dynamic learning
spaces that support students’ learning and development, while honouring and inculcating the values
that anchor our school community. Together, we will create opportunities for our students to discover
their strengths, develop resilience and contribute positively to the community.<br>

Thank you.<br>

Principal, Zhenghua Primary School

# Choir


Always loved to sing but not sure how to develop your voice and sing in tune? Look no further and take the leap as we embark on the journey to create beautiful harmonies with our first and natural instrument – the voice. Apart from singing, we also build musicianship and ensemble skills using the Kodály approach. This would also be useful in the learning of other musical instruments in future.

  

Singing in a group also develops character. Choral singing emphasizes on collaboration and camaraderie, builds resilience through peer encouragement, and teaches the value of respect to trust the direction of the music led by the conductor. Other benefits of group singing includes the improvement of health and mental wellbeing.

# Chinese Dance

In every practice, the instructor will start off with body conditioning moves also known as warmup, which includes stretches, splits and bridges. This series of warmup greatly emphasises on strength, balance and endurance. It also helps our dancers to prepare for the actual dance choreography by increasing their flexibility and reducing the chance of getting injured.

  

Character and citizenship education (CCE) is not only infused into the weekly training practices but also explicitly taught in first ten minutes of each CCA session. Every dancer is given a voice during the discussion as they reflect and jot down their thoughts at the end of each session.

  

Our dancers have participated in various events such as the Bukit Panjang PassionArts Village and Singapore Youth Festival. Through all these performances, our dancers have been able to showcase their talents â€“ truly displaying their unwavering passion for dance. Grace and Glory!

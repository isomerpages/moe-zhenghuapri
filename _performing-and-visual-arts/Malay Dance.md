# Malay Dance

Malay Dance provides a platform for our students an opportunity to learn and experience the different forms of the dance such as traditional and contemporary dance. Practice sessions begin with a 15-minutes warm up lead by either the instructor or CCA leaders. After which, dancers train hard in getting the right dance technique and form.

  

The CCE in CCA sessions conducted at the beginning and at the end of every practice sessions play a vital role in moulding the leaders of character among our dancers. Teachers and instructors impart life skills and values that can never be taught within the four walls of a classroom. In our efforts to always strive for excellence, our dancers are taught the importance of teamwork, perseverance and resilience. During every performance, our dancers never fail to awe the audience with their captivating smiles and graceful performance.

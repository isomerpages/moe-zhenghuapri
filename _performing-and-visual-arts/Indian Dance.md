# Indian Dance

Zhenghua Primary School Indian Dance is unique with its good racial integration of members who are willing to try something new, hence living up to their motto, ‘Dare to be different’.

In Indian dance, students are exposed to a wide variety of Indian dance styles which include Indian classical dances such as Bharatanatyam and Kathak, Indian Folk, Bollywood, Fusion and/or Contemporary. Students are taught the basic classical dance movements which focus on technique and presentation. They also work on stamina building while learning a wide repertoire of movement vocabulary.

Through Indian dance, students develop their character, learn values, social emotional competencies and skills to prepare them for future challenges.

Over the years, our dancers have been able to showcase their talents confidently and truly display their unwavering passion for dance.

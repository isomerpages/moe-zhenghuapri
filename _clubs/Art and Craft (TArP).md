# Art and Craft (TArP)

Budding artists are channelled to the Talent Art Programme (TArP) which maximises students’ talents in their art. Our young artists’ talents are further developed and nurtured. They are provided with opportunities to develop their visual literacy and critical thinking skills. Students get to inquire and discover various ways to interpret the various art concepts through deep discussion and meaningful art processes, and learn to make choices and solve problems when working on their artwork.

  

Our programme has always capitalised on different platforms available to give avenues for our students to present and grow in confidence, a desire of us to equip students with 21st Century Competencies. Our students get to participate in the various exciting platforms to showcase their artistic talent. They have always been involved in partnership projects with Bukit Panjang Community Club in their PassionArts programmes. A collaboration with NGS also allowed our students to broaden their insights in the area of art genre and mediums.

  

Students are active participants in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition and they have presented in Art Outreach, another SYF fringe activity, to showcase their love for art to the general public.

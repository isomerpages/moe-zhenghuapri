Greenovation
============

The Greenovation Club was established in 2022. The CCA has a twin focus on green efforts (learning about the environment we live in and how we can protect it) as well as innovative practices (brainstorming and creating prototypes on feasible solutions for environmental issues). We welcome students who have a passion in championing for a cause in sustainable living and would like to improve the current state of affairs through innovating. In the CCA, they are exposed to STEM and tinkering activities through their commitment and participation in competitions and showcases. In the long run, we hope to nurture environment enthusiasts and solution-aspiring individuals.

Students can look forward to: <br>
Skills Training<br>
Competitions <br>
Learning Journeys<br>
Talks by Knowledgeable Others <br>
Significant Environmental Events<br>

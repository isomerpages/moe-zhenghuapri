# Robotics

Robotics Club members learn to build different variation of robot models and program them to enable their robots to move, line track and even dispense objects. In weekly sessions, missions are given and members are expected to participate actively and work in teams to enrich their skillset and make the mission a success. They learn CoSpace Rescue programming language and participate in relevant competitions too. Membersâ€™ critical thinking, teamwork and problem-solving skills are developed through these hand-on learnings.

  

Character development is infused into weekly training practices. Members have to handle with Care and be Responsible for the equipment given to them. They have to display Resilience since programming is a skill that requires logical thinking, patience and lots of trial and error. They are also encouraged to strive to complete the given missions during the sessions.

Set up GIRO and Edusave Standing Order Online for School Payments
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that the savings in the Child Development Account (CDA) under the Baby Bonus Scheme cannot be used to pay for your child’s/ward’s miscellaneous fees.

  

We would like to invite you to join our GIRO scheme and enjoy the hassle-free and convenient payment arrangement. In this way, your child/ward will not need to bring additional cash to school monthly. In addition, for Singapore Citizen P1 students, you can sign up to use your child’s/ward’s Edusave account to pay for the 2nd tier miscellaneous fees and enrichment programmes to reduce your out-of-pocket expenses.

You may sign up for GIRO and Edusave online by accessing the online forms via the links provided below.<br>

#### Guidelines for Parents

  

**_Parents: Parents should write to seek school leaders’ permission at least one week in advance should <u>the child need</u> to be excused due to official commitments such as external competitions and exams. Parents should submit a medical certificate or a note if the child is absent from school._**

  

*   It is permissible for students to bring their mobile phones to school. Students are fully responsible for their mobile phones and these must be in their possession at all times. The school will not be held liable for any loss or damage.

*   Mobile phones are to be **switched off** and **not** be placed in silent or vibration mode during curriculum time. There should be no disruption to any lesson.

*   After curriculum hours, the only places in school where mobile phones can be used are the canteen, lobby and at Gates 1, 2 and 3.

*   Use of the mobile phone is restricted only to important matters, such as calls to parents to confirm pickup.

*   Use of the camera function of the mobile phone is **strictly prohibited** within the school compound.

*   In accordance with National Examination rules, students are not allowed to bring their mobile phones or any other electronic equipment during the examination period.

*   The mobile phone will be confiscated if the above regulations are not adhered to and will only be returned to parents in school. Repeated offence may render this privilege of carrying mobile phone to school withdrawn from the student.

ZERO TOLERANCE TO BULLYING
--------------------------

Every child has the right to feel safe and secure. Bullying is a hurtful behavior that undermines this right and hinders effective learning and healthy development. It involves repeated or persistent behaviours (e.g. hurting, frightening or intimidating others) intended to cause hurt, distress or humiliation. Bullying is a complex issue and it can be physical, verbal or social in nature.

  

The school takes a serious stand against bullying. All students who bully will be dealt with in accordance to the Discipline Policy. Students are to report such incidents to their teachers. We urge parents to monitor your children closely and inform the school if there are signs of bullying.


What does zero tolerance mean?

Immediate action will be taken by our teacher for ALL acts of bullying, no matter how big or small.


*   Teacher will inform parent that his/her child was bullied. (victim)

*   Teacher will inform parent that his/her child bullied. (bully)

*   Teacher will mete out consequence to the ‘bully’ – detention (refer to Discipline Policy) and conduct grade awarded will be ‘Fair’.

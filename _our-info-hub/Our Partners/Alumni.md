# Alumni

Welcome to the Zhenghua Primary School Alumni Club (ZHPSAC)!
------------------------------------------------------------

As a graduate of Zhenghua Primary School, you belong to a group of over 60,000 Leaders of Character who are vibrant, creative and innovative people, determined to live up to the school motto, “To be the Best that We can be.”

  

We are certain that you would agree when we say that friends made at ZHPS remain friends for life. We have heard of many fond memories that fellow alumni share with us on their ‘good old ZHPS days’ and one just cannot help but feel the joy, warmth and spirit of loyalty and love for their alma mater.

  

So why don’t you continue your ties with us and together with the school help to realise our vision of developing Leaders of Character, Critical and Creative Thinkers and Lifelong Learners?

The ZHPSAC:

The primary objective of ZHPSAC is to foster closer relationship between alumni members and contribute back to the school and larger community.

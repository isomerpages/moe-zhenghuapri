# Alumni Association

##### Welcome to the Zhenghua Primary Alumni Association

The Zhenghua Primary Alumni Association was formally formed in 2023 with a small team of Alumni. Since then the Association has been generously supporting the school and enriching our students’ school life with the Alumni’s rich life and work experience through talks and conversations.<br>
Supporting the Association are our Alumni Youth which was started in 2024. The Alumni Youth members work closely with our current students to provide leadership and role modeling in contributing to the community.<br>
Apart from members from the Alumni Association and Alumni Youth, the Co-curricular Activites in the school has been increasingly receiving support from non-member Alumni. Each contributing with their unique strength.<br>
At the moment, the Association aspires to reach and recruit active members and leaders who wishes to partner us in enriching the young minds in Zhenghua Primary school.

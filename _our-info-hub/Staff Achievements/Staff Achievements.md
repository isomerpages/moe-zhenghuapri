Staff Achievements
==================

In Zhenghua Primary, our dedicated and caring staff are committed to work collaboratively in ongoing processes of collective inquiry and action research to achieve better results for the students they serve. Through the subject-based Professional Learning Teams (PLTs), the staff meet to clarify essential student learning, develop common assessments for learning, analyze evidence of student learning to close learning gaps and create innovative student-centric lesson packages to ignite the Joy of Learning in students.

Several PLTs have collaborated with partners from the MOE Divisions such as Curriculum Planning & Development Division (CPDD) and Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy(PESTA), National Institute of Education (NIE) and external organizations such as National Gallery of Singapore (NGS). Support from our partners have helped to enhance our student-centric lesson packages.

Each year, some of the PLT projects and department projects and lesson packages are shared with the fraternity at various platforms. Our School Leaders would like to acknowledge the following PLTs and staff who shared at zonal, national and international platforms.
